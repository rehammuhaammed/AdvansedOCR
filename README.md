Advanced OCR APP


this app addresses the complex task of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for both 
printed and handwritten text, aiming to enhance accuracy and efficiency in digitizing 
textual information from diverse sources like scanned documents and images. 
quality, advanced text detection methods to identify text regions within complex images, 
and a combination of traditional OCR and modern algorithms to ensure effective 
recognition of both printed and handwritten text. Additionally, the system integrates 
multiple correction models to enhance accuracy by rectifying spelling errors and refining 
outputs. Through these strategies, the project achieves significant improvements in OCR  accuracy and reliability, offering a robust solution for accurate text recognition and 
digitization to meet the increasing demand for efficient data handling across various 
industries
